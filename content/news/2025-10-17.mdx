  title: "株式会社衝動 raises pre-seed funding and unveils Pixie Shield",

We’re excited to share two milestones today: the completion of our pre-seed fundraising and the first public introduction of **Pixie Shield**, our developer-first security scanning platform. These steps advance our mission: *“Infrastructure for rapid resilience. Disasters change lives overnight. We build modular systems that can restore essential services, governance, and community within seven days.”*

# Funding announcement

We have secured an investment from **スパークル1号ファンド**.

Security sits at the base of resilient infrastructure. To restore critical services in days, the software layers that power those services must be trustworthy by default. This round enables us to:

* accelerate research on our graph- and ML-based detectors,
* expand early pilots with design-partner customers, and
* harden enterprise features (governance controls, CI/CD automation, and remediation workflows).

# Introducing Pixie Shield

Pixie Shield brings **one-command, 10-minute** security scanning with an approach that combines **discrete mathematics and machine learning** to drive false positives toward zero—so developers can focus on real fixes instead of noise. Our initial enterprise pricing is **¥1,000,000 per year (unlimited use)**, with scanning designed to complete in minutes and a target **false-positive rate under 5%**. Pixie Shield analyzes code using a **Code Property Graph** foundation and is built to integrate cleanly into modern CI/CD.

# Why we’re building a security tool (and how it ties to infrastructure)

Our company builds **modular systems that communities can stand up within seven days**. In modern crises, cyberattacks and software supply-chain risks can degrade physical recovery as surely as damaged roads or power lines. By delivering accurate, automation-friendly AppSec first, we create the secure software substrate our broader “Nation-as-a-Service” vision requires.

# What’s next

Pixie Shield is under active development, and today’s post is our first public reveal on the site. In the coming months we’ll:

* broaden private pilots with security-conscious engineering teams,
* continue refining our detectors to further suppress false positives and surface actionable fixes, and
* share more about our open developer workflow and enterprise rollout path (as outlined in our product brief’s phased plan).

If you’re interested in partnering on early access, please reach out via **[shodohq.com](https://shodohq.com/)**. Thank you for your support as we build the security and infrastructure tools that make rapid resilience possible.
