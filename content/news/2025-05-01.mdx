# Announcing the Founding of 株式会社衝動

Today marks the official founding of **株式会社衝動**, a company dedicated to creating infrastructure systems that can restore life and order within seven days.
Our mission is simple but ambitious: to make recovery predictable — not accidental — in moments of crisis.

When disaster strikes, time becomes the most precious resource. 株式会社衝動 develops **modular, autonomous, and rapidly deployable infrastructure** designed to rebuild the essentials of civilization: power, water, shelter, and communication.
We believe that resilience is not just a goal, but a technology — one that can be engineered, taught, and scaled across communities.

# Looking Ahead

株式会社衝動 was founded on the belief that technology should serve humanity’s most urgent needs.
We aim to bring together engineers, civic leaders, and global partners to create systems that help communities rise again — faster, safer, and stronger.
Our work begins now, and we invite those who share this vision to join us.

**Rebuild the world, in seven days.**
